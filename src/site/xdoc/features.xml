                            The main pages of the site are grouped into a navigation
                            bar which is always visible.

                            The direct access to the inner pages is done through the

                            The management of a set of services is maintained by XPages
                            which are always visible ( search engine, site plan,

                            Some open-source softwares have been added as services
                            ( full-text indexing, search engine ).

                                The portlets, within which is placed web content, have
                                a known type, depending on its content. The available
                                portlets are article list( news, agenda ,..), data sheets,
                                normal text or HTML, XML Document, person list, Downloadable
                                files, internet links list, naviagation links list within
                                the site, Web syndication( RSS format).

                                The insertion of the portlets into a page follows a composition model
                                , which organises itself into rows and columns ,can be fully parametrizable.
                                The page-setting is also controlled by style sheets(CSS).

                                The seperation of content and view is possible by opting
                                for XML as the exchange format. The XML files consist
                                of structured data, extracted from the database.

                                The dynamic rendering  of page content is managed by the
                                transformation of XSLT content from XML data and style
                                sheets associated to each portlet.

                                Models for page-setting are predefined for each portlet
