<font size="+3">Cache Tag</font>
<br>
<br>
<p>The cache tag implements rudimentary content caching.</p>

<p>It has three parameters:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>

<tr><td>scope</td> 

<td>The scope in which to cache the data: context, session, request,
page.</td></tr>

<tr><td>name</td>

<td>The name identifying the cached content.</td></tr>

<tr><td>duration</td>

<td>The length of time in miliseconds for which the cached content is valid (in other
words, the length of time the cached content can be used without
refreshing).</td></tr>

</table>

</html>
