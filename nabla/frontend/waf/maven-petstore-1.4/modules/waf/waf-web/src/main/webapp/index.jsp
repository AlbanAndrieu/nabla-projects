<p>Welcome to the Web Application Framework (WAF) sample application. This application
is used to demonstrate and test the various WAF components.
<br/>
The WAF is made up of a set of tag libraries, a templating servlet for doing composite view,
a front controller for receiving requests, and a EJB controller for processing requests.
<br/>
Together these components can be used as the base for a web application. For more information
on the WAF and  its usage please see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/index.html">Designing Enterprise Applications with the Java 2
Platform, Enterprise Edition, Second Edition</a> or you can link to information in the online version of the
book <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier4.html">
here</a>.
