This j2ee directory contain code samples for the "Building J2EE applications 
with Maven" article published by O'Reilly (TODO: Add URL when published).
It contains a conversion of parts of the Ant builds from Petstore and xPetstore 
projects to a Maven build.

All source files are copyrighted by the Petstore and xPetstore projects. The
only part that is under an Apache license are the Maven build files.

You need Maven 1.1 beta 2 or later to run the samples.
